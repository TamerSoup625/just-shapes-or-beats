This is a free and open source version of the original game made with Godot Engine which includes an example level, +ERABY+E CONNEC+10N (its song can be downloaded [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3npCLBbg-s)).

By downloading the project and opening it with the Godot Engine, you can create custom levels (and hazards) by following the `MANUAL.md` manual, included in the source code.

This game was also made to sort-of honor the original game. If you haven't played it, [do it NOW!](https://www.justshapesandbeats.com/) It is a very great rhytmic bullet hell.
